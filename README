----------------- ### pake ### ------------------
a quick and easy posix-compliant build system

-> installation
# chmod +x pake
# mv pake /usr/bin

-> usage
pake will search the current directory for a file 
named pakerc this file contains information for pake
to use when building for building the program. 

if the file isn't found, it will use its built in 
defaults for building the source code.

--> available configuration options
as of now, there are 4 config options that you can 
change with pakerc 

  (this list is subject to change in the future):

      - CC
          the selected compiler.
        
      - ARGS
          arguments for said compiler
          
      - SOURCE_FILE
          the source file for the compiler
      
      - OUT_FILE
          the name of the compiled binary

-> should you use pake?
if your looking for a feature full replacement for make
then this isn't for you.

if you just want to get things done quick and dirty
without bashing your head into the screen trying to 
remember makes weird syntax, then this is for you

-> what's to expect
while I did say above that this isn't a feature full 
replacement for make, I will still try to expand its
feature set at least to the level that make is where 
applicable.
