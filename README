pake build tool

	synopsis
		pake [target] [arguments]

	description
		pake is a simple posix compliant build script that
		allows for extensive configuration in a familiar
		format with no external dependencies

	configuration
		targets can be defined in switch "$1" on line 51
		of the script as a string like so:

		case "$1" in
			"build")
				echo "this will run on './pake build''"
			;;
		esac

		even though it isn't shown, it is reccomended to have
		a default case for unexpected behavior.

	installation
		requirements
			curl
			posix compliant shell

		run the following in your shell:
			
		$ curl -L https://github.com/abanoub-R/pake/raw/main/pake -o ./pake
		$ chmod +x ./pake

		the above only copies pake itself, not the LICENSE or README files
